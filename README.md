This project is made with correspondence to the challenge given by the Programming Society on "Best hack related to health". 

MyHe@lth is a project to exhibit calculators regarded to different health aspects, including BMI, required calories, body fat and menstrual cycle, written in HTML, 
CSS and vanilla Javascript.

### Functionality of different calculators
The BMI calculator (made by Siren) uses the obesity standard from the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/obesity/). The calculator will let you choose measuring units
(Imperial/Metric), and will output the BMI value after inputting the suitable height and weight.

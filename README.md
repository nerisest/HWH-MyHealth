Team members: Nicholas Bunjamin ([Sbzro12345](https://github.com/Sbzro12345)), Siren Tse ([nerisest](https://github.com/nerisest)), Lucas Man ([LucasMYS](https://github.com/LucasMYS)), Stelios Neokleous ([SteliosN](https://github.com/steliosn)), Osborn Liu ([osborn123](https://github.com/osborn123))

This project is done with correspondence to the challenge given by the Programming Society on "Best hack related to health". 

MyHe@lth is a project to exhibit calculators regarding different health aspects, including BMI, required calories, body fat and menstrual cycle. It's written in HTML, 
CSS and vanilla Javascript. An app version was later developed by Osborn.

### Functionality of different calculators
The BMI calculator uses the obesity standard from the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/obesity/). The calculator will let you choose measuring units
(Imperial/Metric), and will output the BMI value after inputting the suitable height and weight.

The calorie calculator calculates the required daily amount based on the user's weight, height, age, gender and activity level. It also offers different
measuring units for the input (Imperial/Metric). The output will be displayed after the button press, with the value rounded to 2 decimal places.

The body fat calculator calculates the body fat percentage based on weight and thickness in multiple skinfold areas, such as the triceps and thigh. There are
no different measuring units to be chosen, but the provided units are given in the text prompt. The outputted value is also rounded to 2 decimal places.

The menstrual cycle calculator tries to predict when the next period date for the user, based on their last period date and the average length of their period. The prediction will display a predicted 
date, as well as a range of it. A calendar is provided to choose the specific date for the last period date entry.
